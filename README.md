## Why RxSwift
* Declarative
* Functional and reactive
* Consistent patterns and operators
* Handle mutable state
* Compositional
* Decoupled
* Multi-platform

## Why Not RxSwift?
* Steep learning curve
* Dependencies
* Adoption
* More responsibilities
* Not a panacea

## RxSwift patterns
- Observer
- Iterator

### Observable <Type>
- Emits an event containing an element
- Subscribers can react to each event emitted
  
### Life cycle of an Observable
